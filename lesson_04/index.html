                <div class="etymology-info info">
                    <p>
                        The English word Germany derives from the Latin
                        Germania, which came into use after Julius Caesar
                        adopted it for the peoples east of the Rhine. The German
                        term Deutschland, originally diutisciu land
                        ('the German lands'), is derived from deutsch (cf.
                        Dutch), which descended from Old High German diutisc
                        'of the people' (from diot or diota 'people'),
                        originally used to distinguish the language of the
                        common people from Latin and its Romance descendants.

                        Germany is the seventh-largest country in Europe.It
                        borders Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech
                        Republic to the east, Austria and Switzerland to the
                        south, and France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the
                        Netherlands to the west. Germany is also bordered by the
                        North Sea and, at the north-northeast, by the Baltic
                        Sea. German territory covers 357,596 km2. Elevation
                        ranges from the mountains of the Alps (highest point:
                        the Zugspitze at 2,963 metres or 9,721 feet) in the
                        south to the shores of the North Sea (Nordsee) in the
                        northwest and the Baltic Sea (Ostsee) in the northeast.
                        The forested uplands of central Germany and the lowlands
                        of northern Germany (lowest point: in the municipality
                        Neuendorf-Sachsenbande, Wilstermarsch at 3.54 metres or
                        11.6 feet below sea level) are traversed by such major
                        rivers as the Rhine, Danube and Elbe. Significant
                        natural resources include iron ore, coal, potash,
                        timber, lignite, uranium, copper, natural gas, salt, and
                        nickel.

                <div class="info">
                    <p>
                        Most of Germany has a temperate climate, ranging from
                        oceanic in the north and west to continental in the east
                        and southeast. Winters range from the cold in the
                        Southern Alps to cool and are generally overcast with
                        limited precipitation, while summers can vary from hot
                        and dry to cool and rainy. The northern regions have
                        prevailing westerly winds that bring in moist air from
                        the North Sea, moderating the temperature and increasing
                        precipitation. Conversely, the southeast regions have
                        more extreme temperatures.
                        From February 2019–2020, average monthly temperatures in
                        Germany ranged from a low of 3.3 °C in January 2020 to a
                        high of 19.8 °C in June 2019. Average monthly
                        precipitation ranged from 30 litres per square metre in
                        February and April 2019 to 125 litres per square metre
                        in February 2020. Average monthly hours of sunshine
                        ranged from 45 in November 2019 to 300 in June 2019.
